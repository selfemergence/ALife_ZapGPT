-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**:
   - **Left Cluster**: There is a small, tightly packed cluster of dots located near the top-left corner of the image. The dots in this cluster are very close to each other, forming a nearly vertical line.
   - **Right Cluster**: The majority of the dots are concentrated in a larger cluster located near the bottom-right corner of the image. This cluster has a more spread-out, triangular shape, with the base of the triangle pointing downward and the apex pointing upward.

2. **Distribution**:
   - The dots in the left cluster are densely packed and occupy a very small area.
   - The dots in the right cluster are more dispersed, creating a gradual spread from a dense region at the bottom to a less dense region as you move upward.

3. **Shape**:
   - The left
