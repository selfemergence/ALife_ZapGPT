-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located on the left side of the image and the other on the right side.

2. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots in the left cluster form a vertical line that is slightly curved or jagged, giving it an irregular appearance.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely packed together, creating a dense vertical column.

3. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots in the right cluster form a more complex shape. The majority of the dots create a vertical line similar to the left cluster, but there is also a horizontal extension at the bottom of the vertical line, forming an "L" shape.
   - **Distribution**: The vertical portion of the cluster is densely packed, while the horizontal portion is more spread out
