-- Description:
The image shows a distribution of blue dots that form two distinct clusters, each resembling an "L" shape. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Clusters**: There are two main clusters of dots.
   - One cluster is located towards the left side of the image.
   - The other cluster is located towards the right side of the image.

2. **Shape**: Each cluster forms an "L" shape.
   - The vertical part of the "L" is positioned at the top of each cluster.
   - The horizontal part of the "L" extends to the right from the bottom of the vertical part.

3. **Distribution**: The dots within each cluster are densely packed, creating a clear and defined "L" shape. There is no significant spread or dispersion of dots outside of these two clusters.

4. **Prompt**: The prompt given was "scattering," which suggests that the dots were intended to be spread out in a dispersed manner. However, the actual distribution in
