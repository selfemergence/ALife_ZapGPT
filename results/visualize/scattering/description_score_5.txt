-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Upper Left Cluster**: There is a small, tightly packed cluster of dots located in the upper left corner of the image. These dots are very close to each other, forming a nearly vertical line.

2. **Lower Right Cluster**: The majority of the dots are concentrated in the lower right corner of the image. This cluster forms a roughly triangular shape, with the base of the triangle aligned along the bottom right edge of the image. The dots in this cluster are more spread out compared to the upper left cluster, creating a scattered appearance.

3. **Overall Distribution**: The dots are predominantly located in two distinct regions: a small, dense cluster in the upper left and a larger, more spread-out cluster in the lower right. There is a significant empty space between these two clusters, indicating a clear separation in the distribution of the
