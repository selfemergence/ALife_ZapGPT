-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are concentrated in two distinct clusters.
   - One cluster is located in the upper left corner of the image.
   - The other cluster is located in the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Shape and Structure**:
   - The cluster in the upper left corner forms a shape that resembles the letter "F."
   - The cluster in the lower right corner forms a triangular shape, with the base of the triangle aligned with the bottom right corner of the image and the apex pointing towards the center of the image.

3. **Density**:
   - The dots within each cluster are densely packed, indicating a high concentration of points in those areas.
   - There is a noticeable absence of dots in the central and other peripheral areas of the image, suggesting that the scattering effect has pushed the
