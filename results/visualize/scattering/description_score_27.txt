-- Description:
The image shows a distribution of blue dots that form two distinct shapes, both of which are reminiscent of the letter "L" rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Left Shape**:
   - The dots form a vertical line on the left side of the image.
   - At the bottom of this vertical line, there is a horizontal extension to the right, creating an "L" shape.

2. **Right Shape**:
   - Similarly, on the right side of the image, there is another vertical line of dots.
   - At the bottom of this vertical line, there is a horizontal extension to the left, also creating an "L" shape.

The overall distribution suggests a symmetrical pattern with two mirrored "L" shapes facing each other. The prompt 'scattering' seems to have resulted in a structured arrangement rather than a random scatter of dots.
