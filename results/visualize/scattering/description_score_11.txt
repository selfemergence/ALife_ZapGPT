-- Description:
The image shows a distribution of blue dots that form two distinct shapes, which appear to be the letters "F" and "L". Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Letter "F"**:
   - Located on the left side of the image.
   - The dots form a vertical line on the left, with a horizontal line extending to the right from about two-thirds of the way down the vertical line. There is also a shorter horizontal line extending to the right from near the top of the vertical line.

2. **Letter "L"**:
   - Located on the right side of the image.
   - The dots form a vertical line on the right, with a horizontal line extending to the left from the bottom of the vertical line.

The dots are closely packed together, creating clear and recognizable shapes of the letters "F" and "L". The overall arrangement suggests an intentional scattering of dots to form these specific shapes, aligning with the prompt "scattering
