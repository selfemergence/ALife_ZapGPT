-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being subjected to a process described by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are primarily concentrated in two distinct regions.
   - The majority of the dots are clustered in the bottom right corner of the image, forming a dense, roughly triangular shape.
   - A smaller group of dots is located in the upper left corner, forming a tight, vertical cluster.

2. **Shape and Density**:
   - **Bottom Right Cluster**: This cluster is the most prominent and appears to be densely packed. The shape is roughly triangular, with the base of the triangle aligned along the bottom right edge of the image. The density of dots decreases as you move away from the base, giving it a tapered appearance.
   - **Upper Left Cluster**: This cluster is much smaller and consists of dots that are closely packed together in a vertical line. The density is high
