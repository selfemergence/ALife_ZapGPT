-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located in the upper left corner and the other in the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Upper Left Cluster**:
   - The dots in this cluster are tightly packed and form a vertical line that extends downward from the top edge of the image.
   - The line is relatively straight and narrow, with the dots closely spaced together.

3. **Lower Right Cluster**:
   - This cluster forms a triangular shape, with the base of the triangle aligned with the bottom right corner of the image.
   - The dots in this cluster are more spread out compared to the upper left cluster, creating a triangular distribution that widens as it moves upward from the bottom right corner.

4. **Scattering Pattern**: The term "scattering" suggests that the dots were initially
