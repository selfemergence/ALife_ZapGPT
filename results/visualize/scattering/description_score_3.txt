-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located in the upper left corner and the other in the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Upper Left Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots in this cluster form a shape that resembles the letter "F."
   - **Distribution**: The dots are tightly packed together, creating a clear and defined shape.

3. **Lower Right Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots in this cluster form a triangular shape, with the base of the triangle pointing towards the bottom right corner of the image.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are densely packed at the apex of the triangle and become more spread out as they approach the base, giving the triangle a cone-like appearance.

4. **Scattering Effect**: The prompt "scattering" suggests that
