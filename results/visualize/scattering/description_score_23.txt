-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located on the left side of the image and the other on the right side.

2. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Vertical Alignment**: The dots in the left cluster are aligned vertically.
   - **Compactness**: The dots are closely packed together, forming a tight, vertical line.

3. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Diagonal Alignment**: The dots in the right cluster are aligned diagonally, starting from the bottom right and extending upwards to the left.
   - **Dispersion**: The dots in this cluster are more spread out compared to the left cluster, creating a triangular or cone-shaped distribution.

4. **Overall Shape**: The combination of the vertical line on the left and the diagonal spread on the right gives the image an overall "
