-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots in the image.
   
2. **Left Cluster**: 
   - This cluster is vertically oriented.
   - The dots are tightly packed in a straight line, forming a vertical column.
   - The column is relatively thin and extends from the top to the bottom of the image.

3. **Right Cluster**:
   - This cluster is located towards the bottom right of the image.
   - The dots form a shape that resembles an "L" lying on its side.
   - The horizontal part of the "L" is shorter and positioned at the bottom.
   - The vertical part of the "L" is longer and extends upwards from the horizontal part.

4. **Spacing and Density**:
   - Within each cluster, the dots are closely spaced, indicating
