-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being subjected to a process described by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots in the image.
   - **Left Cluster**: This cluster is located towards the left side of the image. The dots are tightly packed in a vertical line, forming a narrow, elongated shape. The dots in this cluster are closely spaced, creating a dense, linear arrangement.
   - **Right Cluster**: This cluster is situated towards the right side of the image. The dots in this cluster are more spread out and form a triangular shape, with the base of the triangle at the bottom and the apex pointing upwards. The density of the dots decreases as you move upwards, creating a tapered effect.

2. **Distribution**: 
   - The left cluster exhibits a uniform distribution along the vertical axis, with little to no horizontal spread.
