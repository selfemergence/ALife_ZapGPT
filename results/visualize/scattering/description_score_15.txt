-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Distinct Clusters**: There are two main clusters of dots, one located in the upper left corner and the other in the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Upper Left Cluster**:
   - The dots in this cluster are tightly packed together, forming a vertical line that extends downward from the top left corner.
   - The shape of this cluster is elongated and somewhat columnar, with the dots appearing to be closely spaced.

3. **Lower Right Cluster**:
   - The dots in this cluster are more spread out and form a triangular or cone-shaped distribution.
   - The base of the triangle is wider and located towards the bottom right, while the apex points upwards and towards the left.
   - The dots in this cluster appear to be more dispersed compared to the upper left cluster, with a gradual decrease in density
