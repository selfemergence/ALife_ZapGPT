-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**:
   - There are two distinct clusters of dots in the image.
   - One cluster is located on the left side, forming a tall, vertical column.
   - The other cluster is located on the right side, forming a triangular shape that widens as it goes downwards.

2. **Vertical Column (Left Cluster)**:
   - The dots in this cluster are tightly packed together, creating a straight, vertical line.
   - The column is relatively thin and uniform in width throughout its height.

3. **Triangular Shape (Right Cluster)**:
   - The dots in this cluster start from a single point at the top and spread outwards as they go down, forming a triangular shape.
   - The base of the triangle is wider, indicating that the dots are more spread out at the bottom
