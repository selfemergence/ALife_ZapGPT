-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots, each forming a shape that resembles the letter "F." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Left Cluster**:
   - The dots are concentrated in the upper-left portion of the image.
   - The shape formed by these dots is an "F."
   - The dots are tightly packed, creating a clear and defined shape.

2. **Right Cluster**:
   - The dots are concentrated in the lower-right portion of the image.
   - Similar to the left cluster, these dots also form the shape of an "F."
   - The dots in this cluster appear to be more spread out vertically, creating a taller and narrower "F" compared to the left cluster.

Both clusters are labeled with the text "Final Cell Positions Prompt: 'scattering'." This suggests that the dots represent the final positions of cells or particles after a scattering process, where the prompt "scattering" influenced their
