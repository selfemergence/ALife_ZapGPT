-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located towards the upper left corner and the other towards the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Upper Left Cluster**:
   - This cluster is vertically oriented.
   - The dots are tightly packed together, forming a narrow, elongated shape that resembles a vertical line or column.
   - The cluster starts near the top of the image and extends downward.

3. **Lower Right Cluster**:
   - This cluster is more spread out and has a triangular or cone-like shape.
   - The base of the triangle is wider and located towards the bottom right, while the tip points upwards and to the left.
   - The dots are more dispersed compared to the upper left cluster, creating a gradient effect where the density of dots decreases as you move from the base to
