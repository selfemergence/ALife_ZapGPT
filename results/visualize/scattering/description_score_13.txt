-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots in the image.
   - The first cluster is located on the left side, forming a vertical line.
   - The second cluster is located on the right side, forming an L-shaped pattern with a horizontal segment at the bottom and a vertical segment extending upwards.

2. **Vertical Alignment**: Both clusters exhibit a strong vertical alignment. The dots in each cluster are closely packed together in a linear fashion along the vertical axis.

3. **Horizontal Spread**: The right cluster also shows a horizontal spread at the base, creating the L-shape. This horizontal segment is relatively short compared to the vertical segments.

4. **Scattering Effect**: The term "scattering" suggests that the dots were initially distributed more uniformly but ended up in these concentrated clusters. The scattering effect is
