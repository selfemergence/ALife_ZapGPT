-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are concentrated in two distinct clusters.
   - Each cluster appears to form a shape that resembles the letter "F."

2. **Shape and Structure**:
   - The clusters are mirrored versions of each other, with one cluster positioned in the upper left corner and the other in the lower right corner of the image.
   - Each "F" shape is composed of tightly packed dots, creating a dense and solid appearance.
   - The vertical and horizontal lines of the "F" shapes are clearly defined, with the dots forming straight edges.

3. **Spacing and Density**:
   - Within each cluster, the dots are closely spaced, indicating a high density of points.
   - There is a significant amount of empty space between the two clusters, suggesting that the scattering process caused the dots to move
