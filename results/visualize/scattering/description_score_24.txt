-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located near the top-left corner and the other near the bottom-right corner of the image.

2. **Top-Left Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: This cluster forms a vertical, somewhat irregular column.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely packed together, creating a dense, vertical line that tapers slightly as it extends downward.

3. **Bottom-Right Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: This cluster also forms a vertical column but is more spread out compared to the top-left cluster.
   - **Distribution**: The dots in this cluster are more dispersed, creating a wider vertical column with some gaps between the dots. The column appears to widen slightly as it extends upward.

4. **Overall Distribution**: The dots are concentrated in two separate vertical columns
