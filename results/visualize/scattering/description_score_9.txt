-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located on the left side of the image and the other on the right side.

2. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots in the left cluster form a tall, vertical column.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely packed together, creating a dense, linear shape.

3. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots in the right cluster form a triangular shape, with a wider base at the bottom and a narrower top.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are more spread out compared to the left cluster, with a higher concentration at the bottom that tapers off as it goes up.

4. **Spacing**: There is a significant amount of empty space between the two clusters, indicating a clear separation between the two groups
