-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being influenced by the prompt "scattering." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are primarily concentrated in two distinct clusters.
   - One cluster is located in the upper left corner of the image.
   - The other cluster is situated in the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Shape and Structure**:
   - The cluster in the upper left corner forms a vertical line that curves slightly to the right as it extends downward. The line is dense at the top and becomes slightly more dispersed as it curves downward.
   - The cluster in the lower right corner forms a more compact, vertical column. This column is denser at the bottom and becomes slightly more spread out as it extends upward.

3. **Spacing and Density**:
   - Within each cluster, the dots are closely packed, indicating a high density of points.
   - There is a significant amount of empty
