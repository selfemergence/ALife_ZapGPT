-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots, each with a specific distribution and shape:

1. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots are arranged in a vertical line.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely packed together, forming a straight, narrow column.

2. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots form a roughly triangular shape, with a wider base and tapering to a point at the top.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are more spread out compared to the left cluster, with a denser concentration at the bottom and becoming sparser towards the top.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", it appears that the left cluster represents the initial state where the objects are tightly grouped, while the right cluster represents a state where the objects have been scattered away, resulting in a more dispersed and triangular distribution.
