-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a vertical column of dots on the left side of the image. These dots are tightly packed together, forming a straight, vertical line.

2. **Scattered Cluster**: On the right side of the image, there is a more dispersed cluster of dots. This cluster has a triangular or cone-like shape, with the base of the triangle pointing towards the bottom right corner of the image. The dots in this cluster are more spread out compared to the initial vertical column, indicating that they have been scattered away from their original position.

The overall distribution suggests that the dots started in a compact, vertical arrangement and were then scattered to form a more spread-out, triangular shape. This visual representation aligns with the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", showing the transition from a concentrated group to a dispersed arrangement.
