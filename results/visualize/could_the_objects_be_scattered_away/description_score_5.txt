-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots, each with a different distribution and shape.

1. **Left Cluster:**
   - **Shape:** The dots are arranged in a vertical line.
   - **Distribution:** The dots are closely packed together, forming a straight, narrow column.

2. **Right Cluster:**
   - **Shape:** The dots form a roughly triangular shape, with a wider base and a tapering point at the top.
   - **Distribution:** The dots are more spread out compared to the left cluster, creating a dispersed, triangular pattern.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", it appears that the right cluster illustrates a scenario where the objects have been scattered away from their original position, resulting in a more dispersed and spread-out distribution. The left cluster, on the other hand, represents the objects in their original, closely packed state.
