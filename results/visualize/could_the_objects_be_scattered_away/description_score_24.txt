-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots, each with a specific distribution and shape:

1. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots are tightly packed in a vertical line.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely spaced, forming a straight, narrow column.

2. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Shape**: The dots are more spread out and form a roughly triangular shape, with a wider base and a narrower top.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are more dispersed compared to the left cluster, creating a scattered appearance.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", it appears that the right cluster illustrates the concept of the objects being scattered away from their original tightly packed formation (as seen in the left cluster). The right cluster shows a more dispersed and less ordered arrangement, suggesting movement or dispersion.
