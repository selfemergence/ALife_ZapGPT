-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered away. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: On the left side of the image, there is a vertical line of densely packed dots. This cluster appears to be the starting position of the objects before they were scattered.

2. **Scattered Distribution**: On the right side of the image, the dots are spread out in a more dispersed manner. They form a roughly triangular shape, with the base of the triangle closer to the right edge of the image and the apex pointing towards the left, near the initial cluster.

3. **Direction of Scattering**: The scattering appears to have occurred from left to right, as indicated by the transition from a dense vertical line on the left to a dispersed triangular shape on the right.

4. **Density Gradient**: There is a noticeable gradient in the density of the dots, with the highest density at the initial cluster and a gradual decrease
