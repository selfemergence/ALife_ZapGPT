-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a small, tightly packed cluster of dots located near the top-left corner of the image. These dots are closely grouped together, forming a nearly vertical line.

2. **Scattered Distribution**: The majority of the dots are scattered across the bottom-right corner of the image. This scattered distribution forms a roughly triangular or cone-shaped pattern, with the base of the triangle pointing towards the bottom-right corner.

3. **Empty Space**: There is a significant amount of empty space in the central and upper-right portions of the image, indicating that the dots have moved away from these areas and congregated in the bottom-right corner.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", the image appears to illustrate the result of an action or force that caused the dots to disperse from an initial clustered state to a more spread-out configuration.
