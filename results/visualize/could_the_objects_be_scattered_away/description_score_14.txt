-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: On the left side of the image, there is a vertical column of densely packed dots. This cluster appears to be the starting position of the objects before they were scattered.

2. **Scattered Distribution**: On the right side of the image, the dots are more spread out and form a roughly conical or triangular shape. The base of this shape is wider, indicating that the dots have spread out more horizontally as they moved away from the initial cluster.

3. **Direction of Scattering**: The dots seem to have been scattered away from the initial vertical cluster in a direction towards the right side of the image. The spread suggests a force or movement that pushed the dots outward from the initial position.

4. **Density**: The density of the dots decreases as they move away from the initial cluster. The dots are most concentrated at the
