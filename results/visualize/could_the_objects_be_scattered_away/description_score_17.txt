-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a vertical column of dots on the left side of the image. These dots are tightly packed together, forming a straight, vertical line.

2. **Scattered Cluster**: On the right side of the image, there is a more dispersed cluster of dots. This cluster has a roughly conical or triangular shape, with the base of the cone pointing downward and the apex pointing upward. The dots in this cluster are more spread out compared to the vertical column on the left.

3. **Distribution**: The dots appear to have moved from the initial vertical column on the left to the scattered cluster on the right. This suggests a process where the objects (dots) were initially concentrated in one area and then scattered away to form a more dispersed pattern.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", the image visually represents the result
