-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**:
   - **Left Cluster**: There is a vertical column of dots located on the left side of the image. These dots are tightly packed together, forming a straight, vertical line.
   - **Right Cluster**: On the right side of the image, there is a larger, more spread-out cluster of dots. This cluster has a triangular shape, with the base of the triangle pointing downward and the apex pointing upward.

2. **Distribution**:
   - The dots in the left cluster are uniformly distributed along a vertical line, with no significant gaps between them.
   - The dots in the right cluster are more dispersed, creating a triangular shape. The density of dots appears to be higher near the apex of the triangle and gradually decreases towards the base.

3. **Prompt Interpretation**:
