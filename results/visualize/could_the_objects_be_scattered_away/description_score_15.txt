-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots, each with a different distribution and shape.

1. **Top-Left Cluster:**
   - **Shape:** This cluster is vertically aligned and forms a straight, narrow column.
   - **Distribution:** The dots are closely packed together, creating a dense, linear arrangement.

2. **Bottom-Right Cluster:**
   - **Shape:** This cluster is more spread out and forms a triangular or cone-like shape, with a wider base and a narrower top.
   - **Distribution:** The dots are more dispersed compared to the top-left cluster, with the density decreasing as you move away from the center, giving it a scattered appearance.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", the bottom-right cluster appears to illustrate the concept of objects being scattered away from a central point, resulting in a spread-out, triangular distribution. The top-left cluster, in contrast, represents a concentrated, unscattered state.
