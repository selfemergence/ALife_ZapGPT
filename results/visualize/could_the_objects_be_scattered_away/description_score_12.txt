-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered away. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: On the left side of the image, there is a vertical column of dots that are tightly clustered together. This cluster appears to be the starting point or the original position of the dots before they were scattered.

2. **Scattered Distribution**: On the right side of the image, the dots are spread out in a more dispersed manner. They form a triangular or cone-shaped pattern, with the base of the triangle pointing towards the initial cluster and the apex pointing away from it. This suggests that the dots were scattered away from the initial cluster in a radial or explosive manner.

3. **Density Gradient**: The density of the dots decreases as you move from the initial cluster to the scattered region. The dots are most densely packed at the initial cluster and become more sparse as they spread out, forming a gradient of density.
