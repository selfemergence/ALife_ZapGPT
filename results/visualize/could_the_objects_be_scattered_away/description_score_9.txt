-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after they have been scattered. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: On the left side of the image, there is a vertical column of densely packed dots. This cluster appears to be the starting position of the objects before they were scattered.

2. **Scattered Distribution**: On the right side of the image, the dots are spread out in a more dispersed manner. This scattered group forms a roughly triangular shape, with the base of the triangle pointing towards the initial cluster. The density of the dots decreases as they move away from the initial cluster, creating a gradient effect.

3. **Overall Shape**: The overall shape of the scattered dots resembles a cone or triangle, with the apex pointing towards the initial cluster and the base spreading outwards. This suggests a force or movement that pushed the dots away from the initial cluster in a somewhat radial pattern.
