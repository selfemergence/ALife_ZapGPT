-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being subjected to a process or force that aimed to scatter them away, as suggested by the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?".

Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: On the left side of the image, there is a vertical column of densely packed dots. This cluster appears to be the original position of the objects before they were scattered.

2. **Scattered Cluster**: On the right side of the image, there is another cluster of dots, but this one is more spread out and forms a roughly triangular shape. The dots in this cluster are not as densely packed as in the initial cluster, indicating that they have been dispersed.

3. **Distribution**: The dots in the scattered cluster are more widely distributed compared to the initial cluster. This suggests that a force or process has acted to move the dots away from their original position and spread them out.

4. **Shape**: The
