-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots. Here is a detailed description of their distribution and shape:

1. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Position**: Located near the top-left corner of the image.
   - **Shape**: The dots form a vertical line that is slightly curved or tapered at the top.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely packed together, creating a dense, continuous line.

2. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Position**: Situated near the bottom-right corner of the image.
   - **Shape**: The dots form a more spread-out, triangular shape with a wider base and a tapered top.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are more dispersed compared to the left cluster, with some space between them, especially towards the wider base of the triangle.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", it appears that the image illustrates a scenario where the objects (dots) have been scattered from an initial concentrated state (left cluster) to a more dispersed
