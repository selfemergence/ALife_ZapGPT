-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots. Here is a detailed description of their distribution and shape:

1. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Position**: Located near the top-left corner of the image.
   - **Shape**: The dots form a vertical line that is slightly tapered at the bottom, resembling a cone or triangle standing on its tip.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely packed together, creating a dense, solid appearance.

2. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Position**: Situated near the bottom-right corner of the image.
   - **Shape**: The dots form a wider, triangular shape that is oriented upside down, with the wider base at the bottom and the tip pointing upwards.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are more spread out compared to the left cluster, giving it a more dispersed look, especially towards the wider base.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", it appears that the right cluster illustrates a scenario where the objects have been scattered
