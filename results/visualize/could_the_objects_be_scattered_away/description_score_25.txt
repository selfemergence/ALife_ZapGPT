-- Description:
The image shows two distinct clusters of blue dots. Here is a detailed description of their distribution and shape:

1. **Left Cluster**:
   - **Position**: Located near the top-left corner of the image.
   - **Shape**: The dots are arranged in a vertical line, forming a thin, elongated shape.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are closely packed together, creating a dense, continuous line.

2. **Right Cluster**:
   - **Position**: Situated near the bottom-right corner of the image.
   - **Shape**: The dots form a more spread-out, roughly vertical shape with some curvature or tapering towards the bottom.
   - **Distribution**: The dots are more dispersed compared to the left cluster, with some gaps between them, giving it a less dense appearance.

Given the prompt "could the objects be scattered away?", it seems the image illustrates a scenario where objects (represented by the dots) have moved from a concentrated, vertical arrangement on the left to a more scattered
