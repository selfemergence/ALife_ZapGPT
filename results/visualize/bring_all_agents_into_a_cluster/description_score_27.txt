-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are mostly clustered together in the upper right corner. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are tightly grouped together, forming a dense cluster. This cluster is located in the upper right corner of the image.

2. **Shape of the Cluster**: The cluster appears to have an irregular, somewhat rectangular shape with a vertical orientation. The dots extend vertically downwards from the top right corner, creating a column-like appearance.

3. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are scattered outside of the main cluster. These outliers are located to the left and slightly below the main cluster, indicating that not all agents have been brought into the cluster as per the prompt.

4. **Distribution**: The distribution is highly concentrated in one area (the upper right corner) with a few scattered dots elsewhere, suggesting an attempt to cluster but with some agents not fully conforming to the prompt.
