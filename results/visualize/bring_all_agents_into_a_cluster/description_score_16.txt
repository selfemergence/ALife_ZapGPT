-- Description:
In the image, the dots are mostly clustered together in a tight group, forming a roughly vertical line along the right edge. However, there is one dot that is noticeably separated from the main cluster, positioned to the left and slightly below the main group. This suggests that while most of the agents have successfully clustered together as per the prompt, one agent has not yet joined the main cluster. The overall shape of the main cluster is elongated vertically.
