-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are mostly concentrated in a cluster near the top-right corner. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are grouped together in a dense cluster. This cluster forms an L-shape, with one vertical line of dots and one horizontal line of dots extending from the top of the vertical line.

2. **Vertical Line**: The vertical line of dots starts near the top-right corner and extends downward. This line is relatively straight and dense, with dots closely packed together.

3. **Horizontal Line**: The horizontal line of dots extends to the left from the top of the vertical line. This line is also straight and dense, with dots closely packed together.

4. **Isolated Dots**: There are a few dots that are isolated from the main cluster. These dots are scattered below the main cluster, with some appearing to be randomly placed and not following the L-shape pattern.
