-- Description:
In the image, the dots are primarily concentrated in a specific region, forming a distinct shape that resembles the letter "L" lying on its side. The majority of the dots are clustered together in this "L" shape, with a dense concentration along the vertical and horizontal lines that form the "L." There are very few, if any, dots outside of this clustered region, indicating that the agents have successfully been brought into a cluster as per the prompt. The distribution is tight and compact within the "L" shape, suggesting a high degree of aggregation.
