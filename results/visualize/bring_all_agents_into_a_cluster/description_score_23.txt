-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are clustered together, forming a distinct shape. The overall distribution of the dots is concentrated in a specific area, creating a compact cluster. The shape formed by the dots resembles the letter "T". Despite the original prompt instructing to "bring all agents into a cluster," the dots have organized into this specific shape rather than a simple, formless cluster. This suggests that the agents might have additional rules or behaviors beyond just clustering, leading to the formation of this particular pattern.
