-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are mostly concentrated in a cluster-like formation. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are grouped together in a dense cluster, forming a roughly rectangular shape. This cluster is located towards the upper right corner of the image.

2. **Scattered Dots**: There are a few dots that are scattered outside of the main cluster. These scattered dots are primarily located to the left and slightly below the main cluster, creating a sparse distribution in those areas.

3. **Overall Shape**: The main cluster of dots forms a vertical line that bends horizontally at the top, resembling the shape of the letter "L" rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The scattered dots do not form any distinct shape and appear randomly placed relative to the main cluster.

Given the original prompt "bring all agents into a cluster," it seems that the dots have partially adhered to the instruction, with most of them forming
