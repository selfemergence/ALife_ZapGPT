-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are primarily clustered together in the upper right corner. The distribution and shape of the dots can be described as follows:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are tightly grouped together, forming a dense cluster. This cluster is located in the upper right corner of the image.

2. **Sparse Distribution**: There are a few dots that are scattered outside of the main cluster. These dots are sparsely distributed and are located to the left and slightly below the main cluster.

3. **Shape of the Cluster**: The main cluster of dots appears to be roughly rectangular or square in shape, with the majority of dots concentrated in a compact area.

4. **Prompt Adherence**: Given the original prompt was to 'bring all agents into a cluster,' the image shows a partial adherence to this instruction. While most of the dots have been successfully brought into a cluster, a small number of dots remain outside of this cluster.
