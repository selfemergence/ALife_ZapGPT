-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are primarily concentrated in the upper right corner, forming a shape that resembles an "L" lying on its side. The dots are densely packed in this region, creating a cluster. There are very few dots scattered outside of this clustered area, indicating that most of the agents have successfully been brought into a cluster as per the prompt. The overall distribution suggests a strong tendency for the dots to aggregate in a specific corner rather than being evenly spread out.
