-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are primarily clustered together in the upper right corner. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are tightly grouped together, forming a dense cluster. This cluster is roughly rectangular in shape, with the longer side oriented vertically.

2. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are not part of the main cluster. These outliers are scattered around the main cluster, with some located slightly below and to the left of the main group.

3. **Distribution**: The dots within the main cluster are closely packed, indicating a high density of points in that area. The outliers are more sparsely distributed.

4. **Shape**: The overall shape of the dot distribution is irregular due to the presence of outliers, but the main cluster itself is roughly rectangular.

Given the prompt "bring all agents into a cluster," it appears that the agents have largely succeeded in forming a cluster, but
