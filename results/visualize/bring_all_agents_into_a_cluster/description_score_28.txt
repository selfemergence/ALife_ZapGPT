-- Description:
In the image, the dots are intended to represent the final positions of agents after following the prompt to "bring all agents into a cluster." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are clustered together in the upper right corner of the image. This indicates that most agents have successfully moved into a single, dense group as instructed by the prompt.

2. **Shape of the Cluster**: The cluster of dots forms an L-shape. This suggests that while most agents have congregated, there are still some gaps or spaces within the cluster, leading to this particular shape.

3. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are not part of the main cluster. These dots are scattered below the main cluster, indicating that not all agents have fully conformed to the prompt and some remain isolated.

Overall, the image shows a partial success in clustering the agents, with a significant number of agents forming a dense group,
