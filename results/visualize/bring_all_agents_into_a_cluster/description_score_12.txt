-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are clustered together in a specific pattern. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The dots are concentrated in a tight cluster, which is consistent with the prompt to "bring all agents into a cluster."

2. **Shape**: The cluster forms an "L" shape. This means that the dots are primarily aligned along two perpendicular lines that meet at a right angle.

3. **Density**: The dots are densely packed within the "L" shape, indicating that the agents have successfully congregated into a compact group.

4. **Distribution**: There are no dots outside of the "L" shape, suggesting that all agents have moved into the cluster as instructed by the prompt.

Overall, the image effectively illustrates a successful clustering of agents into an "L" shaped formation.
