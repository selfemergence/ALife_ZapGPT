-- Description:
In the image, the dots are mostly concentrated in a cluster located in the upper right corner. The majority of the dots form a dense, roughly L-shaped cluster along the top and right edges of the image. However, there are a few dots that are scattered outside of this main cluster, notably a small group of dots located towards the bottom center of the image. This distribution suggests that while most agents have successfully clustered together in response to the prompt, a few agents remain separated from the main group.
