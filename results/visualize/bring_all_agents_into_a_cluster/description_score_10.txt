-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are primarily concentrated in a cluster along the top-right corner, forming an L-shape. The majority of the dots are tightly packed together in this region, creating a dense cluster. However, there are a few dots that are scattered outside of this main cluster, appearing as isolated points. These scattered dots are located to the left and below the main cluster, indicating that not all agents have fully conformed to the prompt of being brought into a single cluster. The overall shape of the main cluster is rectangular with a vertical and horizontal alignment, resembling the letter "L".
