-- Description:
In the image, the dots are intended to represent the final positions of agents after following the prompt to "bring all agents into a cluster." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are clustered together in the upper right corner of the image. This indicates that most agents have successfully moved into a single, dense group as instructed by the prompt.

2. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are scattered outside of the main cluster. These dots are located to the right and slightly below the main cluster, indicating that not all agents have fully conformed to the prompt and some remain isolated.

3. **Shape of the Cluster**: The main cluster of dots forms an approximately rectangular shape, with the longer side aligned vertically. This suggests that the clustering algorithm or method used might have some directional bias or constraint.

4. **Density**: The density of the dots within the main cluster is high, indicating a successful aggregation
