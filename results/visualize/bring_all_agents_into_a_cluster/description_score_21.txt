-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are mostly clustered together in the upper right corner. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Clustered Region**: The majority of the dots are concentrated in a dense cluster located in the upper right corner of the image. This cluster forms a roughly rectangular shape, with the long side aligned vertically.

2. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are scattered outside of the main cluster. These outliers are located to the left and slightly below the main cluster, creating a sparse distribution in that area.

3. **Shape**: The overall shape of the dot distribution is irregular due to the presence of the main cluster and the scattered outliers. The main cluster itself has a more defined rectangular shape.

Given the prompt 'bring all agents into a cluster', it appears that most agents have successfully clustered together, but a few have not fully integrated into the main group.
