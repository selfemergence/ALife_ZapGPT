-- Description:
In the image, the dots are intended to represent the final positions of agents after following the prompt to "bring all agents into a cluster." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are clustered together in the upper right corner of the image. This indicates that most agents have successfully moved into a single group or cluster as instructed by the prompt.

2. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are not part of the main cluster. These dots are scattered individually at various locations within the image, indicating that some agents did not fully adhere to the prompt and remain isolated from the main cluster.

Overall, the image shows a partial
