-- Description:
In the image, the dots are intended to represent the final positions of agents following the prompt to "bring all agents into a cluster." However, the distribution and shape of the dots do not fully comply with this prompt. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Cluster Formation**: Most of the dots are clustered together in the upper right corner of the image, forming a dense group. This indicates that a significant number of agents have successfully moved into close proximity to each other, adhering to the prompt.

2. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are isolated from the main cluster. Specifically, there are three noticeable outliers:
   - One dot is located roughly in the center of the image.
   - Two dots are positioned vertically below the main cluster, aligned with its left edge.

3. **Shape of the Cluster**: The main cluster of dots forms an L-shape. The majority of the dots are aligned horizontally near the top right corner, with a vertical column of dots extending
