-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are primarily clustered together in a corner, forming an L-shape. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Cluster Formation**: The majority of the dots are tightly grouped together in a dense cluster, indicating that most of the agents have successfully moved into close proximity to each other.

2. **L-Shape**: The cluster forms an L-shape, with one vertical line of dots and one horizontal line of dots intersecting at the top right corner of the image. This suggests that the agents have congregated along two perpendicular edges.

3. **Outliers**: There are a few dots that are not part of the main cluster. These outliers are scattered around the main cluster, with some dots located slightly below and to the left of the main group.

4. **Distribution**: The distribution is highly concentrated in the L-shaped region, with a few isolated dots spread out, indicating that while most agents have clustered together, a small number
