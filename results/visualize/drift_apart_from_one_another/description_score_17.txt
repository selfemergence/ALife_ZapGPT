-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." The distribution and shape of the dots can be described as follows:

1. **Two Distinct Clusters**: There are two main clusters of dots, each located in different regions of the image.
   
2. **Vertical Cluster**: One cluster is vertically aligned and positioned towards the left side of the image. The dots in this cluster are closely packed together, forming a straight, vertical line.

3. **L-Shaped Cluster**: The other cluster is located towards the right side of the image and forms an L-shape. The horizontal part of the L is near the bottom right corner, while the vertical part extends upwards from the horizontal section.

4. **Separation**: The two clusters are well-separated from each other, with a significant empty space between them. This separation is consistent with the prompt "drift apart from one another."

Overall, the dots have drifted apart into two distinct and
