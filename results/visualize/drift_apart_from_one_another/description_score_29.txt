-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that appear to have drifted apart from one another, as indicated by the prompt. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are spread out across the image, with two distinct clusters.
   - One cluster is located near the top-left corner of the image.
   - The other, larger cluster is situated near the bottom-right corner of the image.

2. **Shape and Arrangement**:
   - The cluster in the top-left corner forms a roughly vertical line, with dots aligned closely together.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right corner has a more complex shape. It starts with a horizontal alignment at the bottom, then curves upwards and to the right, forming a shape that resembles a hook or an elongated "J".
   - Within the larger cluster, the dots are more densely packed in some areas and more sparsely distributed in others, particularly as they curve upwards.
