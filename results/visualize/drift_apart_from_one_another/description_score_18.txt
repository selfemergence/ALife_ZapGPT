-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that have drifted apart from one another, as indicated by the prompt. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a dense vertical cluster of dots on the left side of the image. These dots are closely packed together, forming a tall, narrow column.

2. **Dispersion**: As you move to the right, the dots begin to spread out horizontally. This dispersion creates a triangular or cone-like shape, with the base of the triangle pointing to the right.

3. **Final Spread**: Towards the right side of the image, the dots are more widely spaced, creating a broader distribution. The density of dots decreases as they move further to the right, resulting in a more scattered arrangement.

Overall, the dots start in a tight, vertical cluster on the left and gradually drift apart, forming a triangular shape that spreads out to the right. This visual representation effectively illustrates the concept of drifting
