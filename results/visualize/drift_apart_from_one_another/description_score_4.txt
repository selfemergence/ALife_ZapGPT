2. **Shape and Arrangement**:
   - The cluster in the top-left corner forms a vertical line or column of dots.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right corner forms an L-shape. This cluster has a horizontal segment extending to the right and a vertical segment extending upwards from the end of the horizontal segment.

3. **Spacing**:
