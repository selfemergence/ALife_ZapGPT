-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that appear to have drifted apart from one another, as indicated by the prompt. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are spread out across the image, with noticeable gaps between clusters.
   - There are two primary clusters of dots: one located towards the top-left corner and the other towards the bottom-right corner.
   - The dots in each cluster are closely packed together, but the clusters themselves are separated by a significant distance.

2. **Shape of Clusters**:
   - The cluster in the top-left corner forms a roughly vertical line or column.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right corner forms a more complex shape, with a horizontal line extending to the right and a vertical line extending upwards from the end of the horizontal line, creating an "L" shape.

3. **Spacing and Separation**:
   - Within each cluster, the dots are tightly packed with minimal space
