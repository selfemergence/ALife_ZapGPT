-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that appear to have started from a more concentrated cluster and have "drifted apart from one another," as indicated by the prompt. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There seems to be a dense cluster of dots on the right side of the image, forming a roughly vertical line that then curves slightly to the left and downward.

2. **Dispersion**: From this initial cluster, the dots spread out in various directions. Some dots move upward, some to the left, and others downward, creating a fan-like or triangular shape.

4. **Overall Shape**: The overall shape of the distribution resembles a
