-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, each forming a vertical line.
   - One cluster is located on the left side of the image.
   - The other cluster is located on the right side of the image.

2. **Separation**: The dots in each cluster have drifted apart from each other, creating two separate vertical lines. There is a noticeable gap between the two clusters, indicating that the dots have moved away from each other.

3. **Shape**: Each cluster maintains a linear, vertical shape. The dots within each cluster are aligned in a straight line, suggesting a uniform drifting motion.

4. **Distribution**: The dots are evenly distributed within their respective clusters, with no significant gaps or overlaps between individual dots in each line.

Overall, the image depicts two vertical lines of dots that have
