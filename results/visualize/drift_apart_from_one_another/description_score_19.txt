-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a dense cluster of dots located near the top-left corner of the image. These dots are closely packed together, indicating that they started from a single point or a very small area.

2. **Dispersion**: From this initial cluster, the dots appear to have drifted apart in various directions. The dispersion is more pronounced as you move away from the initial cluster, with dots spreading outwards.

3. **Final Distribution**: The dots are spread out across the image, with a noticeable concentration in the bottom-right corner. This suggests that the drifting process caused the dots to move away from the initial cluster and congregate in another area.

4. **Shape**: The overall shape of the distribution is irregular but can be described as having a tail-like structure extending from the initial cluster to the final
