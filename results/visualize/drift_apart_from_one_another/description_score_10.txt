-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a small, tight cluster of dots located near the top-left corner of the image. These dots appear to have started together and then drifted apart.

2. **Main Cluster**: The majority of the dots are concentrated in the bottom-right corner of the image, forming a larger, denser cluster. This cluster has a distinct shape:
   - **Horizontal Alignment**: Many of the dots are aligned horizontally near the bottom of the image.
   - **Vertical Alignment**: There is a vertical column of dots extending upward from the horizontal alignment, creating a sort of "L" shape.

3. **Dispersion**: The dots have spread out from their initial cluster in the top-left corner to the main cluster in the bottom-right corner, indicating a drift apart from one another over time.
