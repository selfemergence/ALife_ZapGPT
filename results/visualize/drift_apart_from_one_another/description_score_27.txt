-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a vertical cluster of dots on the left side of the image. These dots appear to have started in a tightly packed group and have drifted apart slightly, but they remain relatively close to each other.

2. **Main Cluster**: The majority of the dots are concentrated in a larger cluster on the right side of the image. This cluster is more spread out horizontally compared to the vertical cluster on the left. The dots in this cluster seem to have drifted apart more significantly, creating a broader distribution.

3. **Shape**: The overall shape of the dot distribution resembles two distinct clustersâ€”one vertical and one horizontal. The vertical cluster is thin and elongated, while the horizontal cluster is wider and more spread out.

4. **Distribution**: The dots in the horizontal cluster on the right appear to have drifted
