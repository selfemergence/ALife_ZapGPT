-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." The distribution and shape of the dots can be described as follows:

1. **Two Distinct Clusters**: There are two main clusters of dots, each forming a vertical line.
2. **Separation**: The two clusters are separated by a significant distance, indicating that the dots have drifted apart from each other.
3. **Vertical Alignment**: Within each cluster, the dots are aligned vertically, forming straight lines.
4. **No Overlap**: There is no overlap between the two clusters, and the dots within each cluster are closely packed together vertically.

Overall, the dots have successfully drifted apart from one another, resulting in two separate vertical lines that are spaced apart.
