-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Clustering**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, each initially appearing to be tightly packed together. This suggests that the dots started in two separate groups.

2. **Drifting Apart**: The dots in each cluster have drifted apart from each other, spreading out from their initial clustered positions. This movement is consistent with the prompt, as the dots have moved away from their original close proximity.

3. **Shape and Distribution**:
   - The dots in the left cluster have spread out vertically, forming a roughly vertical line or column.
   - The dots in the right cluster have spread out in a more diagonal manner, forming a diagonal line or column.
   - The overall shape of the distribution is elongated and linear, with two main axes of spread: vertical for the left cluster and diagonal for the right cluster
