-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are primarily concentrated in two distinct clusters.
   - One cluster is located near the top-left corner of the image.
   - The other, much larger cluster, is situated near the bottom-right corner of the image.

2. **Shape and Arrangement**:
   - The cluster in the top-left corner forms a tight, vertical line of dots.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right corner is more spread out and forms an elongated, somewhat diagonal shape. This cluster appears to have a denser concentration of dots at the bottom-right, with the dots becoming more sparse as they extend diagonally towards the top-left.

3. **Inter-cluster Space**:
   - There is a significant amount of empty space between the two clusters, indicating that the dots have drifted apart from each other as
