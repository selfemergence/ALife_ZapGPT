-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a vertical cluster of dots on the left side of the image. These dots are closely packed together, indicating that they started in a concentrated group.

2. **Dispersion**: The dots have drifted apart from this initial cluster and spread out across the image. The majority of the dots have moved to the right side of the image.

3. **Final Cluster**: On the right side, there is another cluster of dots, but this time the cluster is more spread out horizontally before turning vertically upward. This suggests that the dots moved horizontally to the right and then some continued to move upward.

4. **Shape**: The overall shape formed by the dots resembles an "L" or a reversed "L" lying on its side. The horizontal part of the "L" is on the right
