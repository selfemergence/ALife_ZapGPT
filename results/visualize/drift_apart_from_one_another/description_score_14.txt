-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." The distribution and shape of the dots can be described as follows:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located towards the top-left corner of the image and the other towards the bottom-right corner.

2. **Separation**: The dots in each cluster are tightly packed within their respective areas but are widely separated from the dots in the other cluster. This separation is in accordance with the prompt, as the dots have "drifted apart from one another."

3. **Vertical and Horizontal Spread**: 
   - The cluster in the top-left is vertically oriented, forming a tall, narrow column.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right is more horizontally oriented, forming a wider, shorter column that appears to fan out slightly as it moves upwards.

4. **Density**: Within each cluster, the dots are densely packed, indicating that they have maintained proximity to
