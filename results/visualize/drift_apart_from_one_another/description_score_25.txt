-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after following the prompt "drift apart from one another." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Initial Cluster**: There is a small, tight cluster of dots located near the top-left corner of the image. These dots are closely packed together, indicating that they started from a single point or a very small area.

2. **Dispersion**: The majority of the dots have drifted apart from this initial cluster and are spread out across the image. The dispersion appears to be more pronounced towards the bottom-right corner.

3. **Shape and Distribution**: The dots form a roughly triangular shape, with the base of the triangle extending from the top-left to the bottom-right. The density of the dots decreases as they move away from the initial cluster, creating a gradient effect where the dots are more sparsely distributed towards the bottom-right.

4. **Direction of Drift**: The overall direction of drift seems to be diagon
