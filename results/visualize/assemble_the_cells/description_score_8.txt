-- Description:
In the image, the dots are clustered together in a somewhat elongated, irregular shape. The distribution of the dots appears to be dense and compact, with most of the dots grouped closely together. The overall shape resembles a somewhat curved or bent line or a slight arc, indicating that the dots have assembled into a connected formation. The prompt 'assemble the cells' suggests an intention to gather the dots into a single, cohesive group, which is evident in the image.
