-- Description:
In the image, the dots are clustered together in a somewhat compact and irregular shape. The distribution of the dots suggests an attempt to gather them into a single group, as indicated by the prompt "assemble the cells." The cluster is not perfectly circular or symmetrical; instead, it has an organic, somewhat amorphous shape. The dots are densely packed in the center of the cluster, with fewer dots at the edges, creating a gradient-like effect where the density decreases outward from the center.
