-- Description:
In the image, the dots are clustered together in a somewhat compact and irregular shape. The distribution of the dots suggests an attempt to gather them into a single group, as indicated by the prompt "assemble the cells." The cluster is not perfectly circular or symmetrical; instead, it has a more organic, amorphous form, with some dots appearing more densely packed in the center and others extending outward in a somewhat irregular manner. The overall shape resembles a loose, somewhat elongated blob or cluster of cells that have come together but not formed a perfectly defined shape.
