-- Description:
In the image, the dots are clustered together in a somewhat elongated, oval shape. The majority of the dots are concentrated in the center of this oval formation, with fewer dots extending outward towards the edges. The distribution suggests an attempt to gather or assemble the dots into a single group, which aligns with the prompt "assemble the cells." The overall shape is not perfectly circular but rather resembles an ellipse or a slightly stretched cluster.
