-- Description:
In the image, the dots are clustered together in a somewhat compact and irregular shape. The distribution of the dots forms a rough, semi-circular or crescent-like arrangement. The dots are densely packed in the center and slightly more spread out towards the edges, giving the cluster a somewhat organic and natural appearance. This configuration seems to respond to the prompt "assemble the cells" by gathering the dots into a cohesive group.
