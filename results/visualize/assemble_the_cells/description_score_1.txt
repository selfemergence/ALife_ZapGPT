-- Description:
In the image, the dots are clustered together in a somewhat elongated, oval shape. The distribution is dense in the center and tapers off towards the edges, creating a gradient effect where the dots are more concentrated in the middle and become sparser as you move outward. This clustering suggests an attempt to follow the prompt "assemble the cells" by grouping the dots closely together in a cohesive form.
