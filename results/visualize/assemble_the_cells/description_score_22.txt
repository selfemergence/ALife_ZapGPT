-- Description:
In the image, the dots are primarily clustered together in a dense group, forming a roughly circular or elliptical shape. The majority of the dots are concentrated in this central cluster, indicating that they have successfully assembled in response to the prompt "assemble the cells." However, there is one dot that is noticeably separated from the main cluster, positioned to the right and slightly below the central group. This lone dot suggests that not all cells have fully assembled with the main group. The overall distribution shows a strong tendency toward aggregation, with one outlier.
