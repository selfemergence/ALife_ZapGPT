-- Description:
In the image, the dots are clustered together in a somewhat compact and irregular shape. The distribution of the dots suggests an attempt to follow the prompt "assemble the cells" by grouping them closely together. However, the shape is not perfectly uniform or symmetrical; it appears more like a loose, amorphous cluster with some dots slightly separated from the main group. The overall arrangement indicates an aggregation of the dots, but without a highly defined or structured form.
