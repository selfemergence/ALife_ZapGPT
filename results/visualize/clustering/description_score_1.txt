-- Description:
The image shows a collection of dots that are clustered together in a specific region. Here are the key observations about the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Clustering**: As indicated by the prompt, the dots are indeed clustered. They are not spread out evenly across the image but are concentrated in a particular area.

2. **Location**: The cluster of dots is located in the bottom right corner of the image.

3. **Shape**: The shape of the cluster appears to be roughly triangular or cone-like, with the base of the triangle pointing towards the bottom right corner and the apex pointing towards the top left within the cluster.

4. **Density**: The density of the dots is highest at the base of the triangle and gradually decreases as you move towards the apex, creating a tapered effect.

5. **Background**: The rest of the image is mostly empty, with no dots present in the majority of the space, emphasizing the clustered nature of the dots in the specified region.
