-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots.
   - The first cluster is located near the top-left corner of the image. The dots in this cluster are tightly packed in a vertical line.
   - The second cluster is located near the bottom-right corner of the image. The dots in this cluster are more spread out but still form a somewhat vertical line with a slight curve at the bottom.

2. **Distribution**: 
   - The dots in the top-left cluster are very close to each other, forming a nearly solid vertical line.

3. **Shape**: 
   - The top-left cluster has a straight, vertical shape.
   - The bottom-right cluster has
