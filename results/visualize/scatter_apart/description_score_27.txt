-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in a manner that appears to follow the prompt "scatter apart." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are spread out across the image, with two distinct clusters.
   - One cluster is located in the upper left corner, forming a vertical line that resembles the letter "I".
   - The other cluster is located in the lower right corner, forming a shape that resembles an "L" lying on its side.

2. **Shape and Formation**:
   - In the upper left corner, the dots are tightly packed in a vertical line, creating a straight, thin column.
   - In the lower right corner, the dots form a horizontal line that abruptly turns vertical, creating an "L" shape. The horizontal part of the "L" is relatively thin, while the vertical part is thicker and tapers slightly as it ascends.

3. **Spacing
