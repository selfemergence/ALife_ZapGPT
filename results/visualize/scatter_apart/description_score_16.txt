-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Concentration in the Bottom-Right Corner**: The majority of the dots are concentrated in the bottom-right corner of the image. They form a dense cluster that gradually spreads outwards, creating a triangular or cone-like shape.

2. **Sparse Distribution Elsewhere**: Apart from the concentrated cluster in the bottom-right corner, there are very few dots scattered in other areas of the image. Specifically, there are two dots located near the top-left corner, which are isolated from the main cluster.

3. **Gradient of Density**: Within the main cluster, the density of dots decreases as you move outward from the bottom-right corner. This creates a gradient effect where the dots are most densely packed at the base of the cluster and become more spread out towards the top and left edges of the cluster.

4. **Overall Shape**: The overall
