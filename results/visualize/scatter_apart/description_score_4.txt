-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located on the left side of the image and the other on the right side.
   
2. **Left Cluster**: The dots on the left side are arranged in a vertical line that extends from the top to about one-third of the way down the image. The dots are closely packed together, forming a straight, vertical column.

3. **Right Cluster**: The dots on the right side are arranged in a more complex shape. They form a horizontal line near the bottom of the image, with a vertical column extending upward from the right end of this horizontal line. The vertical column appears to taper as it goes upward, with fewer dots at the top.

4. **Spacing**: Within each cluster, the dots are closely spaced. However, there is a significant gap
