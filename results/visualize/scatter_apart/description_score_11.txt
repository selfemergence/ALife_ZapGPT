-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in a manner that appears to follow the prompt "scatter apart." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Overall Distribution**: The dots are spread out across the image in a way that creates two distinct clusters or shapes.
   
2. **Shape and Clusters**:
   - **Left Cluster**: On the left side of the image, there is a vertical line of dots that extends downward from the top. This line is relatively straight and thin.
   - **Right Cluster**: On the right side of the image, there is a more complex shape. It consists of a horizontal line of dots extending from the right edge towards the center, with a vertical line of dots extending downward from the end of the horizontal line. This creates an "L" shape.

3. **Spacing**: The dots within each cluster are closely spaced, forming continuous lines. However, the two clusters are separated by a significant amount of empty space
