-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in two distinct clusters. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: 
   - There are two primary groups of dots.
   - One cluster is located in the upper left corner of the image.
   - The other cluster is located in the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Shape of Clusters**:
   - The cluster in the upper left corner forms a shape that resembles the letter "F".
   - The cluster in the lower right corner forms a shape that resembles the letter "L".

3. **Distribution**:
   - The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, forming dense groups.
   - There is a significant amount of empty space between the two clusters, indicating that the dots have scattered apart from each other.

Given the prompt 'scatter apart', the image effectively illustrates the concept of dots that were initially together but have moved away from each other to form separate,
