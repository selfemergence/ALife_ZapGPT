-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in two distinct clusters. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: 
   - There are two primary groups of dots.
   - One cluster is located in the upper left portion of the image, forming a shape that resembles the letter "L" or a corner.
   - The other cluster is situated in the lower right portion of the image, forming a triangular or cone-like shape with the wider base at the bottom right and tapering upwards and to the left.

2. **Scattering**:
   - The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, but the two clusters themselves are spaced apart from each other.
   - The overall distribution suggests an attempt to scatter the dots apart into separate groups, as indicated by the prompt 'scatter apart'.

3. **Shape and Orientation**:
   - The cluster in the upper left is more linear and angular, following the shape of an "L
