-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that form two distinct shapes, which appear to be attempts to create the letter "F" and the letter "L" separately. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Letter "F"**:
   - The dots form a shape that resembles the letter "F".
   - The vertical stem of the "F" is slightly curved or jagged due to the distribution of the dots.
   - The horizontal bar of the "F" is relatively straight but has some irregularities in the spacing of the dots.

2. **Letter "L"**:
   - The dots form a shape that resembles the letter "L".
   - The vertical stem of the "L" is straight but has some gaps between the dots.
   - The horizontal bar of the "L" is relatively straight but also has some irregularities in the spacing of the dots.

3. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are not evenly
