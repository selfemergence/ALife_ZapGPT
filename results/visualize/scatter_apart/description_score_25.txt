-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots.
   - One cluster is located towards the upper left portion of the image.
   - The other cluster is situated towards the lower right portion of the image.

2. **Shape of Clusters**:
   - The cluster in the upper left appears to be vertically elongated, forming a tall, narrow column.
   - The cluster in the lower right is more triangular in shape, with a wider base near the bottom right corner and tapering upwards to a point.

3. **Distribution**:
   - Within each cluster, the dots are closely packed together, indicating a high density of points in those areas.
   - There is a significant amount of empty space between the two clusters, suggesting that the dots have moved apart from each other as instructed by the prompt.
