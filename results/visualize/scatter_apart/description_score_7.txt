-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located on the left side of the image and the other on the right side.
   
2. **Vertical Alignment**: The cluster on the left is vertically aligned, forming a tall, narrow column of dots.

3. **L-Shaped Cluster**: The cluster on the right forms an L-shape. The vertical part of the L is tall and narrow, similar to the left cluster, while the horizontal part extends to the right, creating a shorter, wider segment.

4. **Spacing**: The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, but there is a significant gap between the two clusters, indicating that they have scattered apart as per the prompt.

5. **Distribution**: The distribution of dots is not uniform across the image. Instead, they are concentrated in
