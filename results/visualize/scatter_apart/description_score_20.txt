-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Distinct Clusters**: There are two main clusters of dots, each forming a shape that resembles the letter "F."
   
2. **Separation**: The two clusters are separated by a significant distance, indicating that the dots have scattered apart as instructed by the prompt.

3. **Shape of Clusters**: Each cluster maintains the shape of the letter "F," suggesting that while the dots scattered apart, they retained their original formations to some extent.

4. **Density**: Within each cluster, the dots are densely packed, especially at the ends of the "F" shapes.

Overall, the image depicts two separate groups of dots, each forming an "F" shape, scattered apart from each other.
