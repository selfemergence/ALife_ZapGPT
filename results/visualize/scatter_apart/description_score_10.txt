-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots.
   - One cluster is located near the top-left corner of the image.
   - The other cluster is located near the bottom-right corner of the image.

2. **Shape of Clusters**:
   - The cluster in the top-left corner forms a vertical line or column.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right corner forms an L-shape, with a horizontal segment extending to the right and a vertical segment extending upwards from the right end of the horizontal segment.

3. **Distribution**:
   - The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, maintaining the shapes described above.
   - There is a significant amount of empty space between the two clusters, indicating that the dots have scattered apart as prompted.

Overall, the dots have responded to the prompt by moving away from each
