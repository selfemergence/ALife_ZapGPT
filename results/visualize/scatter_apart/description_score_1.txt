-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in two distinct clusters. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Two Main Clusters**:
   - There are two primary groups of dots.
   - One cluster is located towards the top left of the image.
   - The other cluster is situated towards the bottom right of the image.

2. **Shape of Clusters**:
   - The cluster in the top left forms a shape that resembles the letter "F".
   - The cluster in the bottom right appears to form a shape that resembles the letter "L".

3. **Distribution**:
   - The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, forming distinct shapes.
   - There is a noticeable gap between the two clusters, indicating that the dots have scattered apart from each other.

4. **Prompt Interpretation**:
   - The prompt "scatter apart" seems to have been interpreted by having the dots form separate, distinct shapes that are spaced apart from each other.
