   - One cluster is located towards the top-left corner of the image.
   - The other cluster is situated towards the bottom-right corner of the image.

2. **Shape**:
   - The cluster in the top-left corner forms a vertical line that extends downward.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right corner forms an L-shape, with a horizontal segment extending to the left and a vertical segment extending upward from the end of the horizontal segment.

3. **Spacing**:
   - Within each cluster, the dots are closely spaced, maintaining a linear or angular formation.
   - There is a significant empty space between the two clusters, indicating that the dots have scattered apart as prompted.

Overall, the dots have responded to the prompt by moving away from each other
