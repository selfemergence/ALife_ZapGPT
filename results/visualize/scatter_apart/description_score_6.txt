-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located towards the upper left corner and the other towards the lower right corner of the image.

2. **Vertical Alignment**: Within each cluster, the dots are primarily aligned vertically. This means that the dots in each cluster form a roughly straight line that runs from the top to the bottom of the image.

3. **Separation**: The two clusters are well-separated from each other, with a large empty space between them. This separation is consistent with the prompt to "scatter apart."

4. **Density**: The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, creating a dense vertical line in each cluster.

5. **Distribution**: Apart from the two main clusters, there are very few, if any, dots scattered elsewhere in the image. This reinforces the
