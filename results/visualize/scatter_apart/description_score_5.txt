-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots.
   - One cluster is located near the top-left corner of the image.
   - The other, larger cluster is situated near the bottom-right corner of the image.

2. **Top-Left Cluster**: 
   - This cluster consists of a small group of dots that are closely packed together in a vertical line.

3. **Bottom-Right Cluster**:
   - This cluster is more spread out and forms a triangular shape, with the base of the triangle aligned horizontally near the bottom-right corner.
   - The dots in this cluster start densely packed at the bottom-right and become more spread out as they move upwards and to the left, creating a triangular distribution.

4. **Spacing**:
   - Within each cluster, the dots are relatively close to each other.
