-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in two distinct clusters. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: 
   - There are two primary groups of dots.
   - One cluster is located towards the left side of the image, forming a vertical line that extends downward from the top.
   - The other cluster is situated towards the bottom right of the image, forming a more spread-out, triangular shape with the base near the bottom right corner and the apex pointing towards the top left.

2. **Vertical Cluster**:
   - This cluster is tightly packed and forms a nearly straight vertical line.
   - The dots are closely spaced, creating a dense, linear formation.

3. **Triangular Cluster**:
   - This cluster is more dispersed and forms a triangular shape.
   - The density of dots decreases as you move from the base (bottom right) towards the apex (top left) of the triangle.
   - The dots are
