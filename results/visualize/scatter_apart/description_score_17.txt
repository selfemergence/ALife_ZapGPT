-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots.
   - One cluster is located on the left side of the image, forming a vertical line.
   - The other cluster is located on the right side of the image, forming an L-shape with a horizontal segment at the bottom and a vertical segment extending upwards from the right end of the horizontal segment.

2. **Vertical Alignment**: Both clusters have a significant vertical component, with dots aligned in straight lines going upwards.

3. **Separation**: The two clusters are well-separated, with a large empty space between them. This separation is consistent with the prompt to "scatter apart."

4. **Density**: The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, maintaining a dense formation within their respective clusters.

Overall, the dots have scattered into two separate, distinct
