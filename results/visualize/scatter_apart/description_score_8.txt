-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in a manner that generally follows the prompt "scatter apart." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are spread out across the image, with two primary clusters.
   - There is a noticeable gap in the center of the image where there are few to no dots, indicating a deliberate attempt to create space between the clusters.

2. **Clusters**:
   - **Left Cluster**: This cluster is vertically oriented and located towards the left side of the image. The dots form a tall, narrow column.
   - **Right Cluster**: This cluster is located towards the right side of the image and has a more complex shape. It consists of a horizontal line of dots at the bottom, which then curves upwards and forms a vertical column of dots.

3. **Shape**:
   - The left cluster resembles a vertical line or column.
   - The right cluster has a more intricate shape
