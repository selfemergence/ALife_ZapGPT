-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - The dots are primarily concentrated in two distinct clusters.
   - Each cluster forms a shape that resembles the letter "L," but rotated 90 degrees clockwise, making it look like an upside-down "L" or a mirrored "L."

2. **Cluster Details**:
   - The first cluster is located in the upper left quadrant of the image.
   - The second cluster is located in the lower right quadrant of the image.
   - Within each cluster, the dots are densely packed, forming a continuous shape.

3. **Shape**:
   - Each cluster has a vertical line segment that transitions into a horizontal line segment, creating the "L" shape.
   - The vertical segments of the "L" shapes are oriented towards the center of the image, while the horizontal segments extend outward from the center
