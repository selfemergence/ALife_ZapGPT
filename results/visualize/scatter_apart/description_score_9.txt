-- Description:
The image shows the final positions of dots after being prompted to "scatter apart." Here is a description of the overall distribution and shape of the dots:

1. **Two Main Clusters**: There are two distinct clusters of dots, one located on the left side of the image and the other on the right side.
   
2. **Vertical Alignment**: The cluster on the left is vertically aligned, forming a tall, narrow column of dots.

3. **Diagonal Alignment**: The cluster on the right appears to be diagonally aligned, starting from the bottom right and extending upwards and to the left, forming a triangular shape.

4. **Separation**: The two clusters are well-separated, with a significant amount of empty space between them. This separation is consistent with the prompt to "scatter apart."

5. **Density**: The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, especially towards the bottom of the vertical cluster and the bottom right of the diagonal cluster.

Overall, the dots have
