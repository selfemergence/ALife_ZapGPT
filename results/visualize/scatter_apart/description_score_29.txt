-- Description:
The image shows a collection of blue dots that are distributed in two distinct clusters. Here is a detailed description of the distribution and shape:

1. **Two Main Clusters**:
   - There are two primary groups of dots.
   - One cluster is located towards the top-left corner of the image.
   - The other cluster is situated towards the bottom-right corner of the image.

2. **Shape of Clusters**:
   - The cluster in the top-left corner forms a vertical line that curves slightly to the right at the top.
   - The cluster in the bottom-right corner forms a more complex shape. It has a vertical line on the right side, with a horizontal extension to the left at the bottom, creating a sort of "L" shape.

3. **Distribution**:
   - The dots within each cluster are closely packed together, indicating a dense distribution within each group.
   - There is a significant amount of space between the two clusters, suggesting that the dots have been instructed to "scatter
