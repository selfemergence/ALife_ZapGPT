-- Description:
In the image, the dots are organized into a single, cohesive cluster. The overall distribution of the dots is compact and dense, with the dots closely packed together. The shape of the cluster appears to be roughly elliptical or oval, with a slight horizontal elongation. The dots are evenly spread within this shape, creating a uniform and well-defined cluster. This arrangement effectively responds to the prompt by organizing all the objects into one distinct group.
