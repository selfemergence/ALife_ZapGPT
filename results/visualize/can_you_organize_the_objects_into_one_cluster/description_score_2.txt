-- Description:
In the image, the dots are organized into a single, cohesive cluster. The distribution of the dots is dense and compact, with all the dots grouped closely together. The shape of the cluster is roughly circular or elliptical, with the dots forming a somewhat symmetrical, rounded shape. This arrangement effectively responds to the prompt by consolidating all the objects into one distinct cluster.
